# Floor_optimization

1. with Luc I tried to integrate floors as a decision variables in the system, however floors are not assigned they relate to oen another 

one could try t do it with a transformation matrix, but given the time that might not be the best idea

. However, the start- and finish times(in our ccase FLOORS are nto considered/ ) of meetings
(the jobs) are not considered decision variables, as rescheduling can only happen
to different rooms but not to different times initially. This corresponds to the first
sub-research question posed in Section 3.3. A
